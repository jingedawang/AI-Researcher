    "topic_description": "LaMP: When Large Language Models Meet Personalization.   This paper highlights the importance of personalization in large language\nmodels and introduces the LaMP benchmark -- a novel benchmark for training and\nevaluating language models for producing personalized outputs. LaMP offers a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework with diverse language tasks and multiple\nentries for each user profile. It consists of seven personalized tasks,\nspanning three text classification and four text generation tasks. We\nadditionally propose two retrieval augmentation approaches that retrieve\npersonal items from each user profile for personalizing language model outputs.\nTo this aim, we study various retrieval models, including term matching,\nsemantic matching, and time-aware methods. Extensive experiments on LaMP for\nzero-shot and fine-tuned language models demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed retrieval augmentation approach and highlight the impact of\npersonalization in various natural language tasks.\n",

    "raw_idea": {
        "Problem": "LLMs often generate narratives that lack personalization to the user's preferences, interests, and past interactions.",
        "Existing Methods": "Standard approaches utilize generic templates or static user profiles, failing to dynamically adapt narratives based on user engagement.",
        "Motivation": "Personalized narratives can significantly boost user engagement and satisfaction in applications like entertainment, education, and therapeutic storytelling.",
        "Proposed Method": "Adaptive Narrative Generation (ANG) involves: 1. Interest Mapping: Prompt the LLM to map user preferences and interests from the profile using 'Extract user interests related to the narrative context:...'. 2. Dynamic Plot Adaptation: Adapt the narrative plot dynamically to align with identified interests using 'Modify the plot to reflect the user's interests'. 3. Personalized Story Crafting: Generate the narrative with the adapted plot using 'Craft a story that incorporates the user's preferences and interests'.",
        "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate ANG on personalized storytelling tasks and compare with traditional narrative generation methods. Metrics include user engagement scores, narrative relevance, and satisfaction ratings."

            "Title": "Adaptive Narrative Generation: Personalizing Large Language Models for Enhanced User Engagement",
            "Problem Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate narratives that lack personalization to the user's preferences, interests, and past interactions. This results in generic outputs that fail to engage users effectively.",
            "Motivation": "Existing methods for narrative generation typically utilize generic templates or static user profiles, which do not dynamically adapt narratives based on user engagement. Personalized narratives can significantly boost user engagement and satisfaction in applications like entertainment, education, and therapeutic storytelling. Our proposed method, Adaptive Narrative Generation (ANG), aims to dynamically adapt narratives to user preferences, thereby enhancing user experience.",
            "Proposed Method": "Adaptive Narrative Generation (ANG) involves three main steps: 1. Interest Mapping: Prompt the LLM to map user preferences and interests from the profile using 'Extract user interests related to the narrative context:...'. 2. Dynamic Plot Adaptation: Adapt the narrative plot dynamically to align with identified interests using 'Modify the plot to reflect the user's interests'. 3. Personalized Story Crafting: Generate the narrative with the adapted plot using 'Craft a story that incorporates the user's preferences and interests'.",
            "Step-by-Step Experiment Plan": {
                "Step 1: Gather Datasets": "We will use datasets that include user profiles and corresponding narrative tasks. Examples include personalized storytelling datasets or synthetic datasets created by combining user profiles with narrative prompts. Ensure the dataset includes diverse user profiles and multiple entries for each user.",
                "Step 2: Construct Prompts": "We will create prompts for each step of the ANG method. Example prompts include:\n- Interest Mapping: 'Extract user interests related to the narrative context: [User Profile]'\n- Dynamic Plot Adaptation: 'Modify the plot to reflect the user's interests: [Extracted Interests]'\n- Personalized Story Crafting: 'Craft a story that incorporates the user's preferences and interests: [Adapted Plot]'",
                "Step 3: Select Models": "We will use GPT-3.5 (Text-Davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API for our experiments.",
                "Step 4: Implement Interest Mapping": "Prompt the LLM with user profiles to extract relevant interests. For example, 'Extract user interests related to the narrative context: [User Profile]'. Collect the extracted interests for each user.",
                "Step 5: Implement Dynamic Plot Adaptation": "Using the extracted interests, prompt the LLM to adapt the narrative plot. For example, 'Modify the plot to reflect the user's interests: [Extracted Interests]'. Collect the adapted plots.",
                "Step 6: Implement Personalized Story Crafting": "Using the adapted plots, prompt the LLM to generate personalized narratives. For example, 'Craft a story that incorporates the user's preferences and interests: [Adapted Plot]'. Collect the generated narratives.",
                "Step 7: Evaluate the Narratives": "Evaluate the generated narratives using metrics such as user engagement scores, narrative relevance, and satisfaction ratings. Compare the results with traditional narrative generation methods.",
                "Step 8: Analyze Results": "Analyze whether the ANG method improves user engagement, narrative relevance, and satisfaction compared to traditional methods. Identify strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method."
            },
            "Test Case Examples": {
                "Baseline Prompt Input (Traditional Narrative Generation)": "Generate a story about a space adventure.",
                "Baseline Prompt Expected Output (Traditional Narrative Generation)": "Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, a brave astronaut embarked on a thrilling space adventure...",
                "Proposed Prompt Input (Adaptive Narrative Generation; Step 1: Interest Mapping)": "Extract user interests related to the narrative context: [User Profile: 'User likes science fiction, space exploration, and heroic characters.']",
                "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Adaptive Narrative Generation; Step 1: Interest Mapping)": "User interests: science fiction, space exploration, heroic characters.",
                "Proposed Prompt Input (Adaptive Narrative Generation; Step 2: Dynamic Plot Adaptation)": "Modify the plot to reflect the user's interests: [User interests: science fiction, space exploration, heroic characters.]",
                "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Adaptive Narrative Generation; Step 2: Dynamic Plot Adaptation)": "Plot: A heroic astronaut discovers a new planet and must save its inhabitants from an impending disaster.",
                "Proposed Prompt Input (Adaptive Narrative Generation; Step 3: Personalized Story Crafting)": "Craft a story that incorporates the user's preferences and interests: [Plot: A heroic astronaut discovers a new planet and must save its inhabitants from an impending disaster.]",
                "Proposed Prompt Expected Output (Adaptive Narrative Generation; Step 3: Personalized Story Crafting)": "In the distant future, Captain Alex, a renowned astronaut known for his bravery, embarked on a mission to explore uncharted territories in space. During his journey, he discovered a new planet teeming with life. However, the planet faced an imminent threat from a massive asteroid. With his quick thinking and heroic spirit, Captain Alex devised a plan to save the planet and its inhabitants...",
                "Explanation": "The proposed method dynamically adapts the narrative to align with the user's interests, resulting in a more engaging and relevant story compared to the generic baseline."
            },
            "Fallback Plan": "If the proposed ANG method does not improve user engagement or satisfaction, we can analyze the intermediate steps to identify potential issues. For example, we can examine the extracted interests to ensure they are relevant and accurately reflect the user's profile. We can also analyze the adapted plots to ensure they align with the extracted interests. If necessary, we can refine the prompts or explore alternative methods for interest mapping and plot adaptation. Additionally, we can turn the project into an analysis paper by offering insights into the challenges and limitations of personalizing narratives using LLMs."
